    <p><strong>Fall 2017 - Spring 2018</strong> -- I worked on an independent study project
      dealing with the applications of Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG) to 3D rendering and
      Geometry processing software. This culminated in an honor's thesis where I connected
      some of the topics in DDG to their uses in the making of movies and other graphical
      entertainment. The paper is written to be as accessible as possible to any undergraduate
      that has taken Calculus, so please take a look if you are interested. There are
      lots of pretty pictures!

    <p><strong>Summer 2017</strong> -- I worked as part of a summer REU studying and
      calculating a formal group laws for p-adic integers.  Our calculations were mainly
      done in $\mathbb{Z}_5$.

    <p><strong>Summer 2016</strong> -- I worked as part of an REU studying M&ouml;bius
      transformations related to the Schmidt arrangement of $\mathbb{Q}(i)$.
