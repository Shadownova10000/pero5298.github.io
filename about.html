            Oh gosh, where to begin? Well, I was born and raised here in Colorado over in Broomfield, and
            I have been at this school for quite some time. For my undergraduate degree, I majored in
            Mathematics and Chemistry, and I minored in Theatre, Philosophy, and Dance. Outside of school
            I work as an after school teacher for K-12 students in and around Westminster, act as the
            advisor for the anime club on campus, and I occasionaly perform in pieces put on by the CU Theatre
            and Dance department.
